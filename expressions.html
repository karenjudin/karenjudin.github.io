                <p class="Title">Expressions</p>
                <p>What is sure to be an ongoing project for me, this series has evolved and shaped itself in many ways over the past few months. With an interest in personal expression and the human experience, this series has given me a chance to take a closer look at how individuals live both similarly and differently to others. 

Currently, this series is focused on those still in or just outside of their undergraduate college years. While many of these people share a lot of commonalities with both others in the series and myself, (such as being art students or going to Lesley), every individual has their own way of expressing their emotions, reacting to similar questions or comments, talking about their lives, and reacting to a camera. I find it interesting that while we are all at similar points in our lives, we experience the day-to-day very differently, and personality plays a huge role in how people live.
 
As I tried to capture the unique personality of each person in a single photograph, it became harder and harder to define who these people were and how I was interpreting them. Faces began to blend together, expressions became meaningless, and one shot to represent an entire human being felt impossible. Frustrated and lost, I decided that the best way to show these people how I had come to see them was not in one life-size portrait but instead, in the way that I had been looking at them since the moment I set my camera down. I have searched and edited and changed my mind over and over on how to best represent each individual. But it is through many images, a collection of moments and conversations, that these people are best understood. They have made their choices as to how they want to be seen and I have added my own input. But the final product of a larger than life portrait is not my goal here - it is instead the search, the frustration, the laughter, and the understanding that these people are made up of so much more than one simple image can show.
